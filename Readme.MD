Twitter gives a comprehensive API that developers can utilize to download information about tweets in real-time and they can figure out how to utilize it successfully. 

 

The first step is to set up a Twitter Developer Account, if you have already an account on it you can link that account and make an application for the developer one. 

After completing making your developer account you can extract respective data by using Twitter API. 

Twitter API provides developers with access to most of Twitter's features. You can use API to extract data linked with twitter such as tweets, trends etc. 

 

 

When you get the approval, you can make the application with the developer account and it will ask for your application details and its purpose.

Tweepy: 

I’m using Tweepy Library. 

With Python we can import Tweepy and set up the configuration and initialize it with API keys. 

Tweepy is one of the libraries we can install through pip.  

“pip install tweepy”  

Now we have to use the OAuth Interface to authorize our app to access Twitter. Tweepy provides the convenient Cursor interface for iteration through various object types. 

“import tweepy” 

Tweepy provides a collection of classes and methods representing Twitter's models and API endpoints and manages specific implementation which are Data Encoding, Rate Limits, OAuth Authentication, Results, HTTP requests. 

 

Pandas: 

Pandas is another library we are using, which gives us various tools for data analysis. 

You can install Pandas by  

“pip install pandas” 

Pandas has two main data structures for data storage which are Series and DataFrame. 

By using the library Pandas we can represent the data which is more efficient for data analysis with Series and DataFrama data structures 

Pandas has many options to make I/O operations in better ways. It can also read data from many formats.
